## Interactive App Dashboard in Python w/ Panel
#### This is my first attempt at creating a Python dashboard with Panel. I used the CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset from Our World In Data. There are four visualizations - 
  #### 1. CO2 Emissions Over Time By Continent (line graph)
  #### 2. CO2 Emissions Over Time By Continent (table)
  #### 3. CO2 vs GDP Scatterplot (scatterplot)
  #### 4. CO2 Sources By Continent (bar chart) 

###### *** Need to fix the dimensions to fit everything
